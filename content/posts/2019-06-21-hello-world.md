Hello everybody, I'm moving my blog to a new platform, specifically moving from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to a new one writen with [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) whitch is a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework to achieve things like: headless CMS, process markdown files and generate static sites (this is what I'm doing), serve documantation etc. You can see more details on their website, but as I use gridsome here I'll probably post one thing or another about it.

Well, I wonder if can keep this going and maintain a certain quality to the material on it, I'll try to be more pratical about all the subjects here, to split the content in small handleble pieces to achieve simplicity, objectivity and clearness.

See you.
